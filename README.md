👋 Hi, I'm Joël Allen-Caliste
=============================

About Me
--------

I'm a Mathematics graduate (BSc, University of Leicester) with a passion for building AI systems that genuinely serve people. Currently working as Assistant Director at Mathnasium of Wimbledon, where I manage operations for 200+ students whilst developing data-driven solutions to improve educational outcomes.

🔭 What I'm Working On
----------------------

*   **Student Performance Analytics Dashboard**: Full-stack web application that automates risk assessment and KPI tracking, helping us achieve 100% target success rate and boost revenue by £55,000+ since implementation
    
*   **Exploring AI Applications**: Developing intelligent systems for habit formation and goal setting, particularly interested in how AI can factor in user schedules and constraints to provide personalised guidance
    

🎯 My Focus Areas
-----------------

**Conversational AI & NLP**: Passionate about making complex information accessible through natural dialogue systems. My final-year dissertation involved building a financial advice chatbot that improved user satisfaction by 35% through optimised recommendation accuracy.

**Data Engineering & Analytics**: Experience building automated data pipelines, from web scraping with Selenium to cloud deployment on AWS. I believe in turning data into actionable insights that drive real-world impact.

**Ethical AI Development**: Particularly interested in trust calibration challenges in AI systems, especially for sensitive applications like mental health screening and educational interventions.

🛠 Technical Skills

🎓 Education & Background
-------------------------

*   **BSc Mathematics**, University of Leicester (2024)
    
*   **Relevant Modules**: Data Mining & Neural Networks, Financial Mathematics, Functional Data Analysis
    
*   **Current Goal**: Pursuing Masters in AI with focus on Language and Agents
    

🎯 Future Vision
----------------

I'm working towards creating NLP applications that democratise access to essential services - from financial advice to educational support and mental health resources. My goal is to build AI systems that extend human expertise rather than replace it, particularly in sensitive areas where trust and ethical considerations are paramount.

**Current Research Interest**: How can dialogue systems recognise their limits when providing guidance in vulnerable moments? I'm exploring multimodal approaches and reinforcement learning to create more responsible AI assistants.
